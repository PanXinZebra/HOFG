Hierarchical object-focused and grid-based deep unsupervised segmentation method for high-resolution remote sensing images

Pan, X.; Xu, J.; Zhao, J.; Li, X. Hierarchical Object-Focused and Grid-Based Deep Unsupervised Segmentation Method for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images. Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5768. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14225768

# HOFG
The source code used to implement HOFG is provided. "0-Example.ipynb" gives an example of how to use HOFG to perform segmentation, and show results of four iterations. "1-SegmentABigImage.ipynb" gives an example of how to handle very big remote sensing image by two parameters.
The content in this directory is provided for the reviewers to view and verify the performance of the methods presented in this paper. If the paper is accepted, detailed descriptions of all parameters of HOFG and of all functions will be added to this directory. The HOFG code contains many parameters; in each stage of HOFG, the output results can be exported as images and variables to support a detailed analysis of the methodâ€™s execution process.
